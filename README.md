A simple Qt python tool for licensing (british spelling of license) repositories with OSI approved licences.

## open source hackfest

This "was" a submission for the [2025 open source hackathon](https://open-source-hackfest-26947.devpost.com/), it was planed and made from 17/10/2025 to 19/10/2025.

The demo video can be found on github at [demo.mp4](https://coneastdev.github.io/oss-licencer/demo.mp4).

However it was not submitted as I was 13 minutes late publishing it.  ðŸ˜¢

## How To Use

The app has a very rudimentary GUI. The top text bar and button is for the path to the workspace, after that is the licence searcher which grabs licences from opensource.org, you can then click add to inset the licence and disclaimers.

## Requirements

For this to work you must have git on your system, you also need the following python modules.

```pip install requests beautifulsoup4 PySide6```
